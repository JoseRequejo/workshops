# Knight Center MOOC

I was invited to create a "massive open online course," or MOOC, about building bots by the [Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/). 

This repo contains my working notes for the videos associated with that course, along with materials made available to people who took the course.
