**Building Bots: Software You Talk With**

Course Dates: February 5 - March 2, 2018

Welcome to Building Bots: Software You Talk With!

## Goal

For these next four weeks I will be guiding you through the basics of building conversational interfaces -- bots people can talk with -- and deploying them on several platforms, including SMS, Amazon Alexa, and Facebook Messenger.

## Objectives

You will learn the basics of writing a bot -- a software program that responds to humans like a human, either through text or speech. You'll then learn how to make that program accessible to others, including the general public, via several popular platforms, including SMS, Amazon Alexa, and Facebook Messenger.

Most of our work will be done inside a bot-building system called [Dexter](https://rundexter.com). Using Dexter, and a very human-like programming language called RiveScript, we'll actually _write out_ the interactions between bot and human. Then we'll work on ways to use technology to make the bot part even more human-like.

This course is open to anyone interested in building conversational interfaces for pretty much any purpose, though I'm focused primarily in the news and information industry, so I'll draw my examples and my experiences from there.

## Tools/Applications Required

This course requires that you have a computer with an Internet browser. All work is done online, using a variety of free services. You'll need an account on all of these services:

- Dexter, a bot platform we'll be using to build our bots: https://rundexter.com
- Dialogflow, a natural language processor. The service is at https://dialogflow.com, but you log in using a Google account. If you don't have a Google account, sign up for one at https://accounts.google.com/
- Twilio, for SMS texting. Sign up for a free account at http://twilio.com (don't enter any credit card info; you don't need to pay for anything).
- Airtable, an online spreadsheet service Sign up at https://airtable.com
- Amazon Developer Account, for building a voice with Amazon Alexa. Sign up for free at https://developer.amazon.com/. You don't need an Alexa-enabled device for the class; you can hear what Alexa would say in your web browser. But is definitely more fun if you have one or [purchase one](http://amzn.to/2CO2fSu) before the third week in class. If you do, sign up for the developer account with the same email you use to set up your Alexa device.
- Facebook account, for building a Facebook messenger bot. https://facebook.com

## How the course works

First of all, note that this is an asynchronous course. That means there are no live events scheduled at specific times. You can log in to the course and complete activities throughout the week at your own pace, at the times and on the days that are most convenient for you.

Despite its asynchronous nature, there are still structures in place for the duration of the course.

The material is organized into four weekly modules. Each module will be taught by John Keefe and will cover a different topic through videos, presentations, readings and discussion forums. There will be a quiz each week to test the knowledge you've gained through the course materials. The weekly quizzes, and weekly participation in the discussion forums, are the basic requirements for earning a certificate of participation at the end of the course.

This course is very flexible, and if you are behind with the materials, you have the entire length of the course to complete them. We do recommend you complete each of the following before the end of each week so you don’t fall behind:

* Video lectures
* Readings and handouts/exercises
* Participation in the discussion forums
* Quizzes covering concepts from video lectures and/or readings
 
## The course is divided into four weekly modules: 

### Week 0 - Getting Started

* Notes for people taking the course around the world
* More details available on international issues at http://keefe.cc/bots-world

### Week 1 - Introduction to conversational interfaces

* Examples of conversational bots
* Introduction to Dexter, the bot-writing platform
* Build a basic chat bot inside Dexter
* Careful walkthrough of RiveScript, the language Dexter uses
* Make a "button" bot

### Week 2 - Improve your bot’s conversational game 

* Build a question-and-answer bot: The dog-cat bot

* Answering random chitchat, such as "How are you?"
* Training your own intents in Dialogflow
* Writing for good voice and flow, tailoring with variables

### Week 3 - Texting and talking to bots

* Building an SMS bot you can text with
* Using SMS to create surveys that are logged with Airtable
* Building an Alexa fact bot

To communicate with the instructor please post your question(s) in the "questions for instructors” forum.

The instructor will answer questions in this forum, but due to the size of the class, the instructor may not be able to respond to all questions. He will try to answer as many questions as possible, trying to group them and identifying common topics or threads.

## Honor Code

We expect you to behave professionally and be respectful when participating in the discussion Forums. Cheating cannot be controlled in a class like this, but it really goes against your best interest: if you turn in a work that is not yours (or if you turn in something meaningless), you will hurt your learning experience.

**VERY IMPORTANT: The instructors and the Knight Center reserve the right to warn, or even remove from the course, students that do not respect ethical rules regarding exercises and quizzes. This includes respectful communication in the discussion forums with your peers and colleagues.**
 
## Certificate of Completion

A certificate of completion will be available for those who meet all of the course requirements. You will have until to complete the class criteria. After the XXXX, the Knight Center will review your record. After confirmation, of course requirements, the Knight Center will send a message through the course platform with confirmation that you fulfilled the course requirements and you qualify for the certificate. In this message, we will also send you instructions to download a PDF copy of your certificate through the course platform. You will be able to then download your certificate sometime between XXXXX before the course closes down. No formal course credit of any kind is associated with the certificate. The certificate is awarded by the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas to attest to the participation in the online course.

## Requirements for Certificate

For those that meet all of the course requirements, a certificate of completion will be available to download, in PDF format. No formal course credit of any kind is associated with the certificate. The certificate is awarded by the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas to attest to the participation in the online course.

For those that want to receive a certificate of completion for the course, you must meet the following requirements:

1. Complete weekly quizzes with a 70% score minimum by the weekly deadline.
2. Watch weekly video lectures and review weekly readings.
3. Participate in at least 1 discussion forum each week by given deadline.

If all requirements are met, an electronic certificate in PDF format will be emailed to the student.
