# Alexa Fact Skill

Things are moving quickly with Alexa development, and Amazon's tutorials are pretty good. 

First I'll talk in class a little about Lambda functions.

Let's start with [this walkthrough](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-fact/blob/master/step-by-step/1-voice-user-interface.md).

To beta test on an actual Alexa device:

- Must have **all** of the green checkmarks checked. 
- That includes a 108x108 and a 512x512 px logo.
- Invite beta testers 
- If the Amazon account you're using for development is not the one you use for your Alexa device, then you need to invite yourself at the address you use for the device, too.
- Beta testers visit http://alexa.amazon.com ... and should eventually get a pop-up inviting them to participate
- Then the skill gets added.
